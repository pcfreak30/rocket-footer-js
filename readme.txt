WordPress plugin to force all JS to the footer including inline scripts. Depends on WP-Rocket

This is NOT an official addon to WP-Rocket!

== Description ==

This plugin will combine all inline and external JS in the order found on the page and save it to WP-Rocket's cache folder as a new file. All *localized* scripts are excluded and combined to one script, placed before the external script tag.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-rocket-footer-js` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Clear WP-Rocket cache and view HTML source!
